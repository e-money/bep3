# BEP3 for Cosmos SDK

This is a fork of the [Kava](https://www.kava.io/) project's [BEP3](https://github.com/binance-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP3.md) module implementation.

The fork is made from release [v0.12.0](https://github.com/Kava-Labs/kava/tree/v0.12.0). Its main purpose is to decouple the module from the larger Kava application and make it easier to use in other Cosmos SDK based blockchains. No major changes have been made to the module.
